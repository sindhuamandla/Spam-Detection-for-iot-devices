# Spam-Detection-for-iot-devices
Spam detection for IoT devices using message_id and date inputs enhances network security and efficiency by analyzing frequency and timing patterns to identify unusual or repetitive activities indicative of spam.Using lightweight machine learning models that are optimized for low power and computational resources can help in detecting spam. 
Evaluated multiple algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, selecting the model with the highest accuracy and precision.
